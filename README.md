# Design Approach 

The design approach of this application takes the view and business logic of each component seperate. The choice follows basic design principles of seperation of concerns. Separation allows two developers of different experience to work on two different aspects of a component. A skilled developer and work on the business logic of the component while a junior developer can work on the view layer.
